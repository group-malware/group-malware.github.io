                For the subject <q>IS-213 - Open Source</q> we could choose any project as long as it was a project focused on open source.
                We chose to create a game.
                <br><br>
                The game is created using Unity, which utilises C#-scripts along with prefabs and other project resources to allow one to 
                design the entire game within the Unity editor. As only about half of the group had experience with Unity, we decided to 
                keep the game 2D, to keep the complexity relatively low. This allowed us to focus more on the playability of the game. It also
                meant making sprites for the game was a lot simpler. Sprites were created using programs like Aseprite and Adobe Illustrator.
                <br><br>
                While the game was never finished, we still managed to get it to a playable state, where the basic mechanics works mostly as
                we want them to.

                For the subject <q>IS 202 - Programming project</q> we had to create a system where lecturers and students could 
                get information about and interact with courses and modules.
                <br><br>
                The project was completed using only Java, using a TomCat server to host the web pages. The data about various courses, 
                modules and users were stored in a MySQL database.

                For the subject <q>IS-105 - Data Communications and Operating Systems</q> our group was bigger than its current state,
                and we had to split into two groups for the projects. One group created a website that displayed real-time information about
                the International Space Station. 
                <br><br>
                This was accomplished by fetching the GPS-coordinates from a public API, and sending the coordinates to various Google APIs. 
                We were able to retrieve the following:
                <ul>
                  <li>Map placement</li>
                  <li>Country (if applicable)</li>
                  <li>Timezone (only available if country available)</li>
                  <li>Ocean depth / land altitude (if applicable)</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                We were also able to use a different API to fetch the astronuts aboard, and for how long they had been there.
                <br><br>
                The project was created primarily using Golang.
                <br><br>
                Note: the project was created using an older version of Google APIs that are no longer in use.
